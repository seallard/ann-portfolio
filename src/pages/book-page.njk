# This "pagination" block tells Eleventy to create pages from data.
pagination:
  data: books    # Use the `books` collection from our data file.
  size: 1        # Create one page per item.
  alias: book    # In this template, refer to the current item as `book`.

# The `permalink` is where the magic happens.
# It dynamically creates the URL for each page.
# This structure MUST match the href in the gallery link.
permalink: "bocker/{{ book.slug }}/index.html"

# Set the page title dynamically from the book's data.
# This must be inside the front matter.
title: "{{ book.title }}"

# Tell this page to use our main layout.
